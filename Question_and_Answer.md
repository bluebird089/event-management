###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The code provided will output 3 to the console.
In this code, have an array nums containing four elements: [0, 1, 2, 3].  then use the forEach method to iterate over each element in the array. Inside the callback function, you check if the current num is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), and if it is, you increment the count variable by 1. After iterating through all the elements, the count variable contains the count of truthy values in the nums array, which is 3. Hence, when  console.log(count), it will output 3.</i>
